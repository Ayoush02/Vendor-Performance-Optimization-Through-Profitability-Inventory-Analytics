# Vendor-Performance-Optimization-Through-Profitability-Inventory-Analytics

Vendor Performance Analysis Project:
This Vendor Performance Dashboard and Report provides a detailed analysis of vendor contributions, profitability, inventory management, and sales performance. The primary objective was to optimize vendor management, improve profitability, reduce unsold inventory, and ensure efficient inventory turnover.

Key Highlights from the Dashboard
1. Financial Overview:
  - Total Sales: $441.41M
  - Total Purchase: $307.34M
  - Gross Profit: $134.07M
  - Profit Margin: 38.7%
  - Unsold Capital (Inventory): $2.71M
2. Top Vendors & Brands:
  - Top Vendors by Sales: Diageo North America ($68M), Martignetti Company ($39M), Pernod Ricard USA ($32M).
  - Top Brands by Sales: Jack Daniels No.7 ($8M), Tito’s Handmade ($7.4M), Grey Goose Vodka ($7.2M).
  - The top 10 vendors contribute 65.7% of purchases, highlighting vendor concentration risk.
3. Low-Performing Vendors & Brands:
  - Vendors like Alisa Carr Beverage (Score: 0.615) and Highland Wines (Score: 0.708) underperform in sales despite higher margins.
  - Scatter plot shows several brands with low sales and high margins—ideal for targeted promotions or pricing adjustments.
4. Inventory Insights:
  - Unsold inventory valued at $2.71M indicates slow-moving stock and cash flow inefficiencies.
  - High standard deviation in freight costs points to logistics inefficiencies.

Analytical Insights
Correlation Findings:
  - Price changes have minimal impact on sales (-0.012 correlation), suggesting competitive pricing constraints.
  - Strong inventory turnover correlation (0.999) reflects efficient stock movement for fast-selling products.
Profitability Variance:
  - Low-performing vendors have higher margins (41.55%) but weaker sales volumes.
  - High-volume vendors operate at lower margins (31.17%), implying scale-driven profitability.
Bulk Purchasing Impact:
  - Bulk orders result in 72% lower unit costs ($10.78/unit), reinforcing cost benefits of large-scale procurement.

Actionable Recommendations
1. Boost Low-Sales, High-Margin Brands:
  - Launch targeted marketing campaigns or price optimizations to increase volume.
2. Diversify Vendor Base:
  - Reduce reliance on top 10 vendors (65.7% contribution) to mitigate supply chain risks.3.
3. Optimize Inventory:
  - Address $2.71M unsold capital by reducing overstock, implementing clearance sales, and tightening purchase planning.
4. Enhance Vendor Strategies:
  - For high-margin, low-sales vendors: Improve reach via promotions and distribution expansion.
  - For high-sales vendors: Focus on operational efficiency and bundled offers to drive margins.
5. Leverage Bulk Purchasing:
  - Negotiate volume discounts to reduce per-unit costs and maintain competitive pricing.

Conclusion
This analysis highlights a dual focus strategy: improve sales volumes for high-margin, low-performing vendors through marketing and pricing interventions, while optimizing cost efficiency for high-sales vendors. Additionally, tackling inventory inefficiencies and diversifying vendor dependence will enhance profitability, reduce risk exposure, and improve cash flow.
